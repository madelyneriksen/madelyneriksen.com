Hey! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Maddie, a software developer who builds cool apps using React, Python, and containers. Currently, I work on building tools to manage e-commerce catalogs across multiple sites and platforms. I am open to new opportunities where I can solve challenging problems and cooperate with a diverse team.

In my free time, I like growing houseplants, hiking near Los Angeles, LGBTQ+ advocacy, and adding more static analysis tools to my CI/CD pipelines. There's also a [smattering of projects](https://github.com/madelyneriksen/) on my Github profile that I work on.

If you're interested in hiring an experienced Python or Javascript developer, or just want to say hi, please [reach out](/contact/) and get in touch! I'd love to hear from you. You can also [check out](/blog/) some of the things I have written.

See you around!
