I'm a fullstack developer living and working in Los Angeles. I work with a stack of Python, React, and container technologies. I'm passionate about automation, creating tools to make programming _fast_, and increasing my productivity.

I first started programming with Python 2 as a kid, creating programs to help me solve my math homework. In highschool I got my first computer with Linux: a Raspberry Pi. It's still running a few of my personal Django sites!

Now, I'm spending my time creating data collection systems for ecommerce and working on freelance projects. Tools I have built manage, create, and track over 60k listings on multiple marketplaces and websites. When I'm not programming, I like to hike trails around Los Angeles, advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and adopt additional houseplants. I'm also learning Rust on the side, focusing on WebAssembly and FFI libraries to speed up Javascript and Python.

You can find some code samples, designs, and creations of mine [over at my github.](https://github.com/madelyneriksen/) I'm also interested in hearing of new opportunities, partnering up with another developer, or making new friends!

Feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you have any questions, or just want to say hello! Cheers!
