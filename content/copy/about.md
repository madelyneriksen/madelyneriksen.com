I'm a fullstack developer living and working in Los Angeles. I primarily work with Python, React, and container technologies. I'm passionate about automation, creating tools to make programming _fast_, and increasing my productivity.

I first started programming with Python 2 as a kid, creating programs to help me solve my math homework. In highschool I got my first computer with Linux: a Raspberry Pi. It's still running a few of my personal Django sites!

Currently, I'm the lead backend engineer at Postscript. I've built our SMS/MMS infrastructure, sending over a million text messages a day (and counting!). My job often revolves around (ab)using PostgreSQL, Redis, and containers to build efficient and scalable systems. I believe that the simple solution to engineering problems is the best until proven otherwise.

Previously I spent my time creating data collection and email marketing systems for e-commerce companies. I have built some pretty cool tools, some of which tracked over 60k listings on multiple marketplaces and websites using Kubernetes and services written in Python.

When I'm not programming, I like to hike trails around Los Angeles, advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and adopt additional houseplants. I'm constantly learning about new and old technologies. Ask me about Rust or Lisp! ðŸ˜‰

You can find some code samples, designs, and creations of mine [over at my github.](https://github.com/madelyneriksen/) I'm also interested in hearing of new opportunities, partnering up with another developer, or making new friends!

Feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you have any questions, or just want to say hello! Cheers!
